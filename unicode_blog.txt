If you google any sentence in this post, you will find only a single result.
If you're silly enough to enclose your search in quotes when you search, like
so "Another sentence." then it'll show up in Google Trends.

Alternatively, if you copy-paste it somewhere that can be indexed it'll show up
on the first page. This blog isn't being served by me, but if it was I could serve
a slightly different sentence to each visitor and see what each of them did with the
content.

You might think twice about copy-pasting for that next essay huh?

This is possible because of Unicode. You might have heard of it in a story about them
adding more emojis or something else equally banal. Essentially it's a way to turn letters
into numbers. Unicode is an extension for the ASCII encoding which adds support for more languages.
At the time of writing Unicode contains 112,956 characters from almost every language, dead or not,
and, of course, emoji.

Here we find our first technique. Many languages have characters that *look* like the English alphabet,
but aren't. For example, this is an English 'a'. This is a crylic 'Ð°'. Can you tell the difference?
Well your computer can. It turns out that there are enough similar characters that you can make a sufficiently
long string of text unique.

But it doesn't stop there. Unicode also includes six non-display characters which aren't rendered.
With this we can encode any information we want in empty space: . You can't see it, but after that
colon there's the entire text of the bible encoded in base 6. Technically this post is X words long.

Not bad for an hours work.
